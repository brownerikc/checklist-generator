# Checklist Generator
I created this tool to streamline review and signoff processes for writers and help encourage greater compliance. Writers are required to complete checklists for deliverables at a few different points in the documentation process. The problem was that these checklists were poorly maintained, strewn across multiple locations and containing overlapping or possibly contracitory information. Additionally, the steps actually required depended on what type of document created. The most relevant checklists often had multiple items that were not applicable. Rather than wade through this mess, writers often considered checklists busywork and spend minimal time actually performing the tasks listed.

As part of a process committee for writers, I led an effort to solve these problems by creating this tool. The result was three major accomplishments:
* Consolidated multiple checklists into one.
* Displayed only the relevant checklist requirements for the document format and hid everything not applicable.
* Set up a framework for easy maintenance as new checklist items and document formats were added.

Writers quickly took to the new tool, and the company saw greater process compliance.

## Additional Notes
I created this tool as a way to help learn JavaScript. I was also introduced to JSON not long before, and saw this as a way to further explore the capabilities of that data format.

Checklist item descriptions in this public tool are genericized to avoid any possible confidentiality issues.
